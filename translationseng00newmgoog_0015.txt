· The analogous paradox of final m is explicable

’ hy the hypothesis to which the pheuomenon of con
and co points ; via, the m, even in prose, was not
sounded ot cll before a vowel. This reversos the
French practice, which has two modes of pro-
nouncing half the words of the language: but
their final consonant is sounded, not before a con-
sonant, but before a vowel. If the Latius in prose
said: “Bellum quidem campestre novi,” but,
“ Bellu equidem campestre novi‚'' wo can under-
stand that ’

Bellu equidem noui campestre-

Bella equidem novi campestria—-
aro equally good for Dactylic ‘rhythm3 while .

Bellum quidem novi campestre-
is not good.

«Be this as it may, I cannot bear to out off the
nr of monosyllableS, nor of any word if a great stop
follows3 as No. 6, line 6 from end. In Nol, line
15, it would be easy to write virorum; but I prefer
virum. Latin poets seem to evade altogether the
use of Cum, Nam, J am, Quam, dac, before a
vowel: but this may become a slavery. Ι hope
'that Ι cannot corrupt the teste of learncrs by
making Gum api au anapaest aud J arn huic an⁴
iamb.

Where the Peliean of the silent North
sits there an silently.
12. But if thou love the Seuthem sees
And pleasant summer weathen
Come let us mount this gellam ehip
And sail away together.

THE SOUTHERN SEAS„

1. YES, let us mount this gellent ship,¹
Spread oanvas to the wind,
Up 1 we will seek dhe glowing south„
Leave care and cold behind
2. Let the shark pursue through the watens blue
Our flying vessel’s treck,
Iret strong winde blow and rocks below Ἴ
Threaten ;-—we turn not back.
3. Trusting in Him who holds the sea
In his Almighty hand, ¹
We’ss pass the awful wetere wide,
Tread many a far off strand.
4. Right onward es our course we hold,
From day to day the sky
Above our head its arch shall spread
More glowing, bright and high.
5. And from night to night, oh what denght
In ite azure depths to mark
Stare all unknown come glitt'ring out
Over the ocean dark.

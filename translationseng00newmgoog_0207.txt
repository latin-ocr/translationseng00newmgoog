SEOTION VI. “

DIRGE ΟΝ Α FALLEN cmm.

¹ 1. omum not to the gun and the swoml:
The spear of the unbelievm prevails
Boo Khalloom, the good and ιΙιι brave ιι fallen:
. Who can now be safe?
2 As the moon among tholi ιιῙθ stam,
Such was Boo Khalloom among men.
What defence henoefomh can Fezzan hope to find?

3. Men mourn in silent sadness for his loss:
Women sob and shriek,
Rending the air with their eries. ·
Foras a shepherd ιο his flock,
Such was Boo Khanom ιο Fezzmn.¹

’ 4. Give him songs! give him musio!
But what songs ean equal his prame?
His beart was as large as the desart,
His money bags nourish’d all his people,
Like the rich udder of the she camel,
Overflowing with abundant ιιιιιιιιι of milk. .

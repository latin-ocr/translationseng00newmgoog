ODE ΤΟ wlnrnn.

. Wrinrt first the fiery montled Sun .

His heavenly reoe began to run,

Round the earth end ooeen blue

His children four, the Seeoons, flew.
Firet, in, green apparel denoing,

The young Spriop smil'd with angel-greoe
Rosy Sommer next adventing s

Rush’d into her eire’s embreoe;
Her brighr-hair’d sire, who bede her keep
- For ever nearest to hie smiles,
On Calpe's olive-shoded steep,

On Indie's citron-oover’d isles.
More remote, end burron-brown,

The Qoeeo of Vintcrpe bow'd before hie throne :
A rioh pomegronate gemm'd her orown3
ι Α ripe sheaf bound her zone.

But howling Wieter fied ater
To hffls that prop the poler etar3 ’
. And loves on' deer-borne eor to ride,
With barren Derkness by his side,
Round the shore, where loud Lofoden
¹ Whirls to death the rooring whole3
· Round thebeth, where Runio Odin
Howls hie war-song to the gale.

4. I long to hear the thund'ring orash
Of their terrifio foll,
And the eohoes from a thousand oliffs,
Like lonely voices, call
5. There shall we see the fieres white bear,
The sleepy seals aground,
And the spouting wholes, that to and fro
Sail with‘a dreary sound.
6. There maywe tread on depths ol ioe
, That the hairy mammoth hide,
ἵ Perfeot, as when in times of old ’
The mighty ore‘ature died.
7. And while the unsetting sun shines on
Through the still heav’ns deep blue,
We'll traverse the azure wareo, the herda
of the dread sea-horse to view.
8. We’ll pass the shores of solemn pine,
Where wolves and blaok bears prow13
And away to the rooky isles of mist, ¹
To ronse the northern fowl.
9. Up there shall start ten thousand wings
With a rushing whistling din ;
Up shall tho auk and frrlrnar start—
All but tho fat penguin.
10. And there in tho wastes of the silent sky,
With the silent earth below,
We shall see far off to his lonely rook
The lonely eagle go.
11'. Thon softly soltly will wo tread

By inland streame, to see,

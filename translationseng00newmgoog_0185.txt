Sorrow-bow'ck inconsoleble ;
Like e melenehon Feiry,
Art thou, Meedow-Fritillery!

2. Like the head 'of snake enchentei
Where whilom the life heth pented3
All ite purple ehequeringe eealy,
Growing eold end dim and pely5
Like a dregon’e heed well ‘moulded‚
Seely Jews together folded :

Ie the bud so duek end airy
Of the wild Field-Fritillery.

ἵ. Like a joy my memory knoweih,
In my native fielde it groweih;
Like the voiee of one long perterk
Geliing to the faithful heeried;
Like an unexpeeted pleasure,
Thai heth neither seint nor measure.
Like a bountiful good Feiry
,Do Ι hail thee, Frieillary 1

FAIRY NUMBERS.

Ne, not more weleome the feiry numbers ,
Of music sallon the eleeper’e ear,

When, half eweking from feerful elumbers,
He thinks the full quire of heev'n is near ; ·

Then reme that zvoiee, when, eil foreeken,
This heere long hed sleeping lein,

N or thought ite oold pulee would ever weken

, To surh benign· bleeeed erunde again.

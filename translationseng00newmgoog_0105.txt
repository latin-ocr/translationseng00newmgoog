2. Up and down! up and down!
From the base os the wove to the billow’s erown,
And amidst the fieshing ond feethery foeni
The stormy Petrel finds e home,-
A home, if such a place may he,
For her who lives on the wide wide see,
On the eraggy ioe, in the frozen air,
And only seeketh her rooky lair
To worm her young end to teaoh thern spring
At onoe o’er the wave on their stormy wingt

3. O'er the deep! o’er the deep t
Where the whele end the sherk and the swerd-fish sleep.
Outflying the blest and the driving rain,
The Petrel telleth her tole—in vain 3
For the manner ourseth the werning bird,
Who bringeth him news of the storms unheardt
—Aht thus does the prophet, ot good or ill,
'Meet hate from the ereetures he serveth still:
Yet he ne’er faulters :-So, Petrelt spring
Onoe more o’er the waves on thy stormy wingt

“BELIEVE, IF YOU CAN.'’

Tempests ne'er scetter the blossoms of May ;
The wild winde are constant by method and plen.
Oh believe me, believe me, believe ifyou ean!

Spreads the seme halo o'er winter's derk night:

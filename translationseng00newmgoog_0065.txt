2. The proud throne shall crumble,

The diadem 111111 wane 3

The tribes 01 earth shall humble
The pride 01 those who reign,

And war shall lay His pomp away.
The fame that henes cherish,

The glo1y earn'd in deadly frey
Shell fade, dewy, and perish.

Honour waihs o'er all 1110 earth
Throngh endless generations

The 111 1111101110 her harvests forth
And feeds the expectant natione.

ERIN’S DAYS OF OLD.

1. LnT Erin rememben 1110 days of old,

Ere 'her 1111111110 sons betray’d her;

When Meiachi wore the collar 01 gold,
Which he won hom the proud invader.

. When her kings‚ with standard of green unfurl'd,

Led 111101 Braneh* knights 10 danger,

Ere the emerald gem of 1110 western world
Was seh in the erown 01 1 stranger. '

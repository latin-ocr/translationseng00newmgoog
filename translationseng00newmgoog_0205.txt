3. Oheerily then from hiil end valiey, oheerily oh!
Like your native founieins sully, oheen'ly oh!
If a glorioue death, ί won by brerery,
Sweeter be then breath Ι sigh’d in slevery,

Round eh'e fleg of Freedom relly‚ oheerily oh!

THE SEA-KING.

Oonn sing, come sing, of the great Sea-King
And the same theo now hengs 0’er him,
Who once did sweep o'er hhe vanquished deep,
And drove the world before him i
His deok was a throne, on the ocean lone,
And the sea was his park oi pleesure,
Where he eoettered in fear ohe humen deer,
And rosbech—when he had leisure!

Come—shout and sing

Of the great See-King
And ride in the hreek he rode in i
He sits at the head
Of the mighty dead
On the red right hand of Odin!

He sprang, from birth, like a God on ear‘oh, ·
And ooared on his vietor pinions,
And he traversed the sea, ae the eegles fiee,
When they gaze on their blue dominions.
His whole earth-life was a conquering siriie,
And he lived till his heard grew hoery,
And he died at lest, by his blood-red mast,
And now—he is lost in glory.

So,—shouh end sing, do.

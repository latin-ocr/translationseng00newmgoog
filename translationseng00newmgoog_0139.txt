2.· Ι’ν’θ seen our lovelieet maidens:
Their eyes as stara are bright.
' Their voices are sweet as a fountain’a,
That murmure in the light.
But they were not a joy to me,
Aa thora when I look on thee.
Pale Lily of the water, sweet flow’r! sleep.
3. Why droopeth thy head, lone captive? '
Meum not the lov’d ones blest.
In the White man's happy islands
¹ Their spirits are at rest.
Thy image to them shall bearn,
As they are beheld in thy dream.
Pale Lily of the water, sweet flow’rt sleep.

4. My brother is rude to thy sorrow 3
He hath awarrior’s soul.
He is terrible in the battle:
He scorns amaid's controul.
But alarin our father’s home
Thou shalt in my bosom bloom.
¹ Pale Lily ef the water, sweet fiow'rl sleep.

' OMEENA’S LAMENT.

1. WHERE is the feam of the wetere?
White on the golden send it shone,
But a wave from the deep came dark and high ;
Iloek'd, and the feam was gone.
It might not linger.

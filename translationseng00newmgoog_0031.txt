The winde were pillowd on the wevee3
The hannem ‹iroep'd along their eievee3
And es they fell eround them feeling,
Above them ehone the crescent euriing:
And thet deep eiienee was unbroke,

Save whexe the wetoh hie signal ep0k03
Save where the steed neigh'd oft and shrill,
And echo enswer’d fmm the hill;

And the wide hum of thei wild host
Ruetled like leaves from coast io coest,

Ae rose the Muezzin’s voice in air,

In midnight cell to wonted prey'r :

Ii rose, ihet ehented moumful etrein,

Like some lone epirit's 0’er the plain.
’Twas musical, 'twee sedly sweet3

Such es when winde end herpstrings meet,

· And take e long unmeesue'd tone

Το meinai minstrelsy unknown

THE WATERFALL. A

1. Tim weterfelll the weterfelli
How sounde ite sweet melodioue eall
The Alpino velleys through!
Ii stieeks the derk rock'e distent eide;
Ite foem upon the eir doth ride.
' Th0u beeuiifiiil the mountain’e beide3
Fae gliding into view.

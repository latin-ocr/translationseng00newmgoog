MIDHOUR OF NIGHT.

1.

An the midhour of night, when stors ore weeping‚1 fly

Το the lone vole wo lov'd‚ when life was worm in thino eye.
And I think, thot if spirits oon steol from the regions of air
To revisit post soenes of delight, thou wilt oome to me thoro,

And ten me our love is romembor’d, ov'n in tho sky.

’ 11.

Then I sing tho wild song it onoo was rapturo to hear,
When our voioos oommingling brooth'd like one on the oar.

And os tho far off through tho vole my sod orison rollo,

I think, Ο my love! ’tis thy voice hom tho kingdom of muln, ¹
Fointly answering still the notes that oneo were so door. ¹ ¹

OHAMOUNI.

Somno long unknown ho strangeroight,

Moko all thy voles, romantio Chomouni„

A wonder and delight.

The goatherd ond tho shephord ond their fiooks

Pastoring tho omgs oround ;

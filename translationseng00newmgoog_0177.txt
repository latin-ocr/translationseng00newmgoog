Hork l-e blow, ond o dnll sound follows, ·

A second—he hows his heod3
A thim—ond lhe wood's donli hollows
Now know that their king is dead
2. His armo hom their trunio ero m'ven3 ’
His body oll barked ond oquomd ;
And he’s now, like a selon driven
ln chains to the strong dookyard:
He'o sawn through the middle, ond tumeo
For the rihs of a frigote free3
And he'o oeulked, and pitehed end burned3
And now-he’s fit for sea!
3. 0111 now,--with hio wings oulsproad
Like eghost (if a ghost moy be),
He will triumph againhhough dead,
And be dreoded in every see:
Tho lightning will blaze about,
And wrep him in flaming pride 3
And the munder-lond oenum will shout,
In the fight from hio bold broodside.
4 And when he has fought, end won,
And been honoured from shore to shore5
And his joumey on earth io done,-
Why, what oon he osk for morel ’
There io nought dhet o king oen eloim,
Oropoel or wonior hold, ’
Save arhyme ond o shothved neme,
And to mix with the oommon mould

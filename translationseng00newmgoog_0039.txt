Fire turneth him nol, nor sea prevento ι

He is sorongerby sarthan the elemento. ¹
The broad green earth is his prostrate prey,
And he derkens the sun at noon of day.

THE OHILD OF THE SEA.

. ΤΗΕ sea! thesea! the open sea!

The blue, the fresh, the ever free!

Without o mark, wilhoul abeund,

It runneth the earth's wide regions ’round3
Ie plays with the clouds ; il mocks the skies ·‚
Or like aoredled creature lies, '
I'm on the see! I’m on 'ohe sos!

Ι am where 1 w0uld ever be3

With the blue above er'rd the blue below,
And silence whereso’er I go;

If a storm should eome and wake the deep,
What matter? I shall ride and sleep.
Ι love (ohl how Ι love) 'eo ride

On the fieroe foeming bursting lide,
When every mad wave drowns the moon,
Or whistles alofl his lempesl tune,

And tells how goeth the world below
And why the south west blasts do blow.

Ι never was on tho dull tame shore,

But Ι loved 'ohe great sea more end more,
And baokwsrds flew to her billowy breare,
Like a bird that seeketh its mother’s nest:

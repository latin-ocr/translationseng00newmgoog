’ 5. As the flow’rs perish without rain,
So does Fezzan droop,
For Boo Khalloom¹ returns home no mors
His body lies in the land of the heathen.
’ The poison'd arrow of the unbeliever has conquer'd.

6. Oh trust not to the gun and the sword :

The tvsapon of the infidel prevails :
ι Boo Khalloom the good is fallen:
Who can be saie henceforthl

DEATH.

l. 0 Dhshfl, thou great invisible!
Pale monaroh of the unending Pasti
Who shall thy countless trophies tell,
Or when shall be the last l
2. By thee high thrones to earth are flung ;
By thee the swonl and sospite rust:
By thee the beautiful and young
Lie mouldering in the dust.
3. Into thy cold and iaded reign
All glorious things of estth depart:
The fairest forms are early slain
And quench’d the fiery heart.
4. But in yon world thou hast not been,
Where joy* can fade nor hesuty fall:
Ο mightiest of the things unseen,
Save Oim that ruleth allt

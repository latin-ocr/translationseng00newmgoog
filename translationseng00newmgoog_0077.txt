ΤΗΕ OLD GRAY -THRUSH.'

1. OF all the birds of tuneful note,
That werble 0’er field or fiood‚

0 give me the thrush with the speekled throat
sse king of the ringing wood.

2. For he sits upon the topmost twig,
To carol forth his glee,
And none ean danee a merrier jig,
Or leugh more loud then he.

. A. So the thrush, the thrush‚ theold gray thrush‚
Amerry blithe old boy is he; ·
You may hear him on the roadside bush

Orthe topmostsswig of the mountain tree.

3. Ere Spfing arrayed in robes of green,
Bids beautiful flovfrets stare,
He eheereth up dull December’s scene,
With asong from his gushing heert.

4. But sweeter fer are his notes to me,
When, piping to the mom,
He woos the bright sun 0’er the lea

With afiourish of his horn.

A. So sshe thrush,· &e

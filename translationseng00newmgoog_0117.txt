4. And ee the reeords ere,
Which wandering seemen keep,
Led by their hidden oter
Through the oold deep ;
So may the words Ι write
Tell through what sturme I stray, Ι
Yon still the unseen light Ι
Guiding my way.

A MOORISH SERENADE.

1. Wuum my lady eleepeth, Ι the derk blue heav'n is bright:
Soft the moonbeem ereepeth Ι round her bow'r all night.
Thou gentle, gentle breeze, Ι while my lady elumbem,
Walt lightly through the trees Ι eohoes of my numbers.

Her dreeming ear to please.

ι. Should ye,—breathing numbers, Ι that for her lineare-
Should ye break her elumbem, Ι all my soul would grieve
Rise on the gentle breeze Ι eud gain her lattioe height.
O'er yon poplar trees: Ι but be your eohoes light,

As hum of distant bees.

’ 3. ΑΗ the stam are glowing Ι in the gorgeous sky:
ln the stream source flowing Ι mimie lustres lie.
' Blow, blow gentle breeze, Ι but bring no oloud to hide
Their deer resplendenoies : Ι nor ehase from Zunn'n side
Dreams bright end pure es these.

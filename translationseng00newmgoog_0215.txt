Harkl the horn of combel ealle.
Ere the golden evening falle,
c, May we pledge that horn in triumph round!

Many e heart, thet now bears high, ’
In elumber ooldot night shall lle,

Nor wolren ev’n at Viotorfo sound.

But oh how [bleso that hero's eleeps

O’er whom a wondering world shall weep.

Aorno rnn'rlrrnn.

1. Nloflr olos'd eround the conqueror’o way,
And lighlnings show’d¹ the dietant hill,
Where those, who lost thar dreadful day,

' Slood few and faint, but feorless still

2. The soldier’s hope, the pelriot's zeel,
For ever dimm'fl, for ever oroes'd! ·
0 who shall say what heroes leel,
When oll bul life and honour 'e lost?

3. The lost eod honr, of freedom's dream
· And velour's took, mowd slowly by3
While mute they watoh’d, tffl morning'e beem .
Should riso, end give them light to die.

4. ¹ There is a world, where eouls ere free3
Where tyrones taint nol nature's bh'os. χ
If death thar world’s bright opening be,
Ο who would live a slave in thiel

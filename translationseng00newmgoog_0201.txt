Save when adown the raveg'd globe

He trevels on his native storm,
Defiowering Neture’s gressy robe,

And trampling on her feded form,
Till lighes returning lord assume

The 01011 that drives him 10110 poler field,

Of pow’r 10 pieree his raven plume f
And crystal-oover’d shield.

0 sire of etormet whose sevage ear
Τ10 Lapland drum deh'ghts 10 hear,
When F renzy with her bloodshot eye
Invokes thy dreadful deity ;
Archangel ! pow'r of desolation!
Fesh deseending es thou enh,
Say, hath montel invocetion
Spells'to touch thy stony 100111
Then sullen Winten hear my prey’r, .
And gently rule 110 ruin'd year,
N or 01111110 wanderer's bosom bare,
Ner freeze 110 wreteh’s falling tear,
To shuddering Want's unmentled bed
Thy horror-brenehing agnes 0000010 lend,
And gently 011 110 orphen head
of Innocenee descend.

But chiefly spere, O king of clouds!
The sailor in his airy ehrouds5
ἒ When wreeks and beaeons strew the sheep,
And spectres welk along the deep.

,The winter wind than whisssed shrill,
ΤΙιθ snows that night that choked nhe hill„
Rough, wild and pitiless„, had still Χ

’ Far more than Southron clemency.

6. Long have my harp's best notes been gone·;
Few are its strings and faint &heir tone:
They can but sound in desant l'one

Their gray-hair'd master’s misery.
Were each gray hain a minstrel string,
Each chord should imprecatione fling, -
Till startled Scotland lond should ringg

“ Revenge for blood and treenhery.”'

A LADY MORALISING.

1. Tun rain is falling ; the wind is loud3
The morning is hiding behind a cloud ;
Thn stans are soattered by dnwn of day,
But where is my lover? Afar-awny !·.

2. The east is brighter3 the wind is still ε
nm sun is rising beyond tho hill.
It cometh—it shineth; the dawn of dnm
And the step of my lover-2 it eomes thi's- way.

¹ 3. Ah, the 'sky-it changeth‚ the rain-the sum

As the hope that we cherish is lost or won.
What care for the shadows, if hearts be gay!
What use in the summer, if fn'endn ἀοοαγῖ.

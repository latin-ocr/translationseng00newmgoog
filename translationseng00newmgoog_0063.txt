For which the pray'rs of myriad lips
Aspire in fervent trust. ’
11. Else, come there shall, if come it must,
An ever-glorious doom,
Where a whole nation greatly sinkn
In a blood-hallow’d tomb.
12. Then crowding round 1101 00110ηέ grave
The peoples all shall stand,
And millions consecrate the 1001
Το bless the martyr-land.

A firm and faithful part!

She hides 11100 in her 110011.

ODE ΟΝ AN AGRIOULTURAL CELEBRATION.

1. FAR back in the ages
The plough with wreaths was crown’dz

The hands of kings and sagos
Entwin’d 110 chaplet round3
Till men 01 spoil Disdain'd 1101011
By which the world was nourish'd,
And dews of blood enrioh’d 110 soil
Where green their laurels fioun‘sh'd„
N ow the world her fault repairs,
The gunt 1101 stains her story 3
And weeps her crimes amid 110 eures
That form’d her earliest glory.

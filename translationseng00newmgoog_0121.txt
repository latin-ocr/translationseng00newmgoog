100

Of froeenipt leaves that are dropping round,
Or the deep-mouth'd ary of the distant hound
Thai opens on his game.
7. Yet then too I'love the forest wide 3-
Wheiher the sun in splendour ride
And gild its many colour’d side,—
8. Or whether the soft and silvery haze .
In vapoury folda o’er the landskip etiayn,
And half involves the woodland maza
9. Like an early widow’s vei13
Where wimpling tissue from the gaze
The form half hides and half betrays
Of beauty wan and pale.

THE NAUTILUS.

⁸ 1. ann an ocean-breeze afloat,
In a little pearly boat—
Pearl within and round about, ’
And a silken streamer out,
Over the sea, over the sea,
Menily, memily saileth he 1
. Not for battle, not for pelf,
But to pleasure his own salf,

r Sails he on for many a league‚

Α Nor knoweth hunger nor fatigue ;
Past many a rock, past many a shore,
Nor shifts a sail, nor lifts an oar:

0 the joy of sailing ihus,
Like a brave old Nautilus!

4. The bloom of hhe seasons will come, will fly;
And the heavens will alter, we know not why;
But the mind, thar we temper is our damaim
And the truth of the Spirit should nonquer pain

MELROSE ABBEY.

Ir thou would’sb view fair Melroee aright,

(ho visit ie by the pale moonlight ;

For the gay bearna of lightsome day

Gild bue to fiouh the ruins gray.

When the broken arches are blank in night,

And each shafbed oriel glimmers white :

When the eald lighe’s uncertain shower

Streams on the ruin'd central tower3

When huttress and buhhress alternately

Seem frarn'd of eben and ivery ;

When silver edges hhe irnage1y‚

And the scrolls thar teaeh thee ho live and die ;
’ When distant Tweed is heard ho rave,

And the owleh to hoot o’er the dead man’s grave;

Then gra—bue go alone the while,-

Then view St. David's ruined pile;

And home rehurning‚ soothly awear,

Waa never soene so sad and fair.

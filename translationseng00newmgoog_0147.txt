,1. Gonu is the long long winter night.
Look, my beloved one,
How glorious‚ thro' his depths of light,
Rolls the majestis sun 1
The willorrs, wek'd from winter's death
Give oui a fragrance like shy breeih:
The summer is begun. ·
. Ay 1 ’tis the long bnght summer day :
Hark to the mighiy erash!
The loosen’d ieeridge breaks away :
The emitten wasers flssh
’ Sesward the glittering mountain rides,
the down its green translucent sides
· The foamy terrenis dash
’ : . See, love 1 my boet is moor'd for thee
By Oeeen's weedy floor.
The petrei does noi skirn the ses
More swiftly then my oar.
We'll go, where on the roeky isles
Her egge the sereeming sesfowl piles
Resides the pehbly shore.
. Or bide thou where the poppy blows =
With wind flow'rs hail and fair,
While I, upon his isle of sn0w‚
Seek and defy the bear.
Fieree tho' hehe andhuge of frume,
This arm his sevsge strength shall hume,
And drag him from his luir.

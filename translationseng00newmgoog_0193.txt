Speuk es if it were given to thee

Το list to seraphic minstrelsy.

Ay: there thou hest been Not suuny Franco
Or old Itnlie's und of song,

(tun fumieh such notes for the poet’s dunce,
As the melody pour'd frum thy musical tungue.

4 Where hest thou been, my beautiful Springl
Plucking rich plumes horn the puroquet’s wingl
Rubbing the clouds cf their reinbow erest? ,
Bething thyself in the glorious Westl
Rubing thy form in the pescock's hues,

And gethering peerls from the orient dewsl

Else, whence comest thou with this proud err-ay
of beeuties to sprinklc the russet woorl

These Leutlilies bending us if to prcy,
And hyacinthe fringing the merge of the fioodl

. And tell me, whence cometh-my beautiful Spring l
Esch ster cf the earth, esch odorous thing;
These white-fringbd dcisies with goldenuipped eyes,
These buttcrcups glesming like summer-lit eldes,
These violets adorned with rich purple end blue,
These primroses fragrent end innocent too :
, And lestly, the sweetest end richest Iween,
Of ull thy fuir daughters, my beautiful Springl
Ι The buddings thet stud all thy patbwcys with gisen,
Scy, where were they gether'd‚ tc sheke hcm thy vingt

MARS ΑΜ) VENUS.

1. Ineuu eounde the harp when the combat ie over,
When heroes ere reeting and joy isin bloom;
When laurete hang loeee from the brow of the lover
And Cupid makes winge of the wenior's plume.
But when the foe returns, Ι egein the hero burns3
High flames the swerd in his hend once more.
The elang osminglingarme Ι iethenthe soundthateharms,
And brenen notes of wer by thousand trumpets roer.
Ι Oh then eomes the heup‚ &e

2. Light went the herp when the Wer-god reclining

Loy lull'd on the white erm of Beauty to rest ;

When round his rich ermour the myrtle hung twining,
And flighte of young doves made his helmet their nest,

But when the battle came Ι the hero’s eye ⁴breath’d fleme ἶ
Soon from his neck the white erm wae flung ;

While to his wakening ear Ι no other sounds were deor,
But brenen notes of wer by thousand trumpets hung.

3. But then came the light harp‚ when danger was ended,
AndBeeuty once more lull'd the Weu·god to rest3
When tresses of gold with his leurels lay blended‚
⁵ And flights of young dovee mede hie helmet their nest.

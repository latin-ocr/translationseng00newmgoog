And louder than the holte of heav'n
Far flash'd the red a1hillery. ·

5. Bur redder yet thar light shall glow
On Linden's hille of steined snow„
And bloodier yet the torrent flow

Of Iser rolling rapidly. Ι

6. ’ris morn; bui searee yon level sun =
(ian pierre the war-cloude rolling dun,

Ἴ Where furious Frank and fiery Hun

Shout in their suiphurous eenopy. .

7. The combat deepens. On, ye breve!
Who rush to glory or the grave.
Wave Munieh 1 all ihy berners wave‚ “

And charge with all thy chivelry.
8. Few, few shall pari, where many meet:

The enow shall be their winding sheeh3
And every huri heneath their feei
shall be a soldier's sepulchre.

SAILOR’S SONG.

1. While clouds on high are riding
The winiry moonshine hiding,
The raging blasi abiding
' O’er mountain waves we go.
With hind the dry land reaping, -
With townsman ehelter keeping
With lord on eost down sleeping ·
Ohange we ourloii Oh no!

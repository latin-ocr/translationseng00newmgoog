SEOTION IV.

THE FOREST.

1. 'Tls merny in greenwood, (thus runs the old lny‚)
In the gladsome mouth of lively May,
When the wild bird's song on stem end eprey
Invitee to forest bow'n.
2. Then neers the ash his airy erest,
Then ehines the birch in silver vest,
And the beeeh in glisbering leaves is drest,
And derk between shows the oek'e prend breest,
Like a chieftein'e¹ frowning tow’r.
3. Though a thousand brenehee join their seneen,
Yet the broken sunbeeme glenee between,
And tip the leaves with lighter green,
With brighter hints the flow’r.
4 Dull is the heanh that loves not then
The deep necess of the wildweod glen,
Where roe end red-deor find sheltering den,
When the eun is in his pow’r.

5. Leee meny peneheuee ie the feding leef,
That follows eo soon on the gether'd eheef,
When the gxeenwood loeee·the neme.
6. Silenhiethenthe forest-bound,
Save the redbteeet's note, end the running sound

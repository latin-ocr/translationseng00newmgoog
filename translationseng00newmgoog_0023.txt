OANADIAN 13ko som.

1. Fanum as tolle the evening chime,
Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time;
Soon as the woods on shore look dim,
We’ll sing at St. Ann's our parfing hymn.
Row, brothers row3 the stream runs fast3
The rapide are near, and the daylight ἰ paen

2. Why should we yet our sail unfurl2
The're is not a breath the blue wave to curl:
But when the {n'ind blows off the shore,
Oh sweetly weffl rest our weary oar.
Blow, breem blow3 the stmam runs ἰωὴ

sse rapide are near, and the daylight ἰ past.

3. Ottawa's tide! this mmbling moon
shall see us float o’er thy surges soon.
Saint of this green isle! hear our pray’rs 3
Oh grantae 0001 heavens and favouring aits.
Blovv, breezes, bloW, &Q

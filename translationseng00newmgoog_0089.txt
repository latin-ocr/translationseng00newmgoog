2. No, not to theee5 for they have rest.
The mist-wreath has the mountain-eresi,
The stag hie lair, the *erne her nest.
Abode of lone security.
But those for whom I pour the lay,
Not wild wood deep nor mountain gray,
Nor this deep dell thar shrouds from day
Oould sereen from treacherous eruelhy.
. Their flag was furl’d and mute their drum :
The very household dege were dumb,
Unwont to hay ai guests that come
In guise of hospitahty.
His blithesr notes the piper phed,
· Her gayeei snood the maiden tied,
¹ The dame her distaff flung aeide¹
To tend her kindly housewifery.
4. Tm hand thar mingled in the meal,
Aa midnighi drew the selon sieel,
And gave the hoet’s kind breasi to feel
Meed for his' hospitality.
The friendly hearih which warm'd thar hand
Ae midnighr arm’d it with the brand,
Ther bade destruction’s flames expand
Their red and fearsul blazoniy.
5. Then woman’s shriek was heard in vein 3
Nor ipsaney’s unpitied plain
More than the warrior's grean could gain
Respite from rathlees hutehery.

⁸ Beiriek calis the Sea Eagle, the Great Eme.

' IMMORTALITY oe Leve,

ΤΗΕΥ sin, who tell us love cen die:
' With life all other passione fly3
All others ere but vanity.
In heev'n Ambition cannot dwell,
Nor Averiee in the vaulte of helL
Eerthly these passione of the earth,
They pereae where they have their birth. '

But leve is indes‘vruehible:

Its holy fleme for ever humeth ι

From heev'n it came, to heav'n returneth.
Τοο oft on eaxth e troubled guest,

Ae times deeeiffld, at times opprest,

lt here is tried and ptirified,

Then heth in heav'n its perfect rest.

It soweth here with teil end cere,

But the harvest-time of Love is there.

PEAGE AFPER WAR

Now is the winter of our discontent
Mede glorious summer by this sun of York ς

And ell the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the oeeen buried.

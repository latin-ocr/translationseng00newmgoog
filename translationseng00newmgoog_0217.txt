SIINAN RETIREMENT.

e„ Oovee me with your everlasting arms,
Ye guardian giants of this solitudo,
From the ill sight of men, end from the rude
Tumultuous din of yon wide world’s elerms.
Β. Oh knie your mighty limbs around, above,
And close me in for ever 2 let me dwell
With the woodspirite, ¹in the derkest spell*
Thae ever with your verdent looks ye wove.

In one eterne] hymn :-the whispering wind, ,
The shuddering leaves, the hidden watemprings‚
The worksong of the bees, whose honey'd winge
ι). Hang in the golden tresses of the lime,
Or buried lie in purple bede of thymo.

HARP OF THE NORTH.

On the wyehe olm, that shedes St. Fillen’e spn‘ng,

Muffling with veedant ringlet every etring 3-

To win our fathervlend, ⁴
And here the yoke of slavery
Was snephby Hunyed's hand. .
5. Here Freedom's banner, dyed in bloed,
Shone proudly from afar3 ’
Here fell the brevest of our breve
In long protracted war. ·
6. Yet, efter many e feheful chance ¹
And dangers wild end grand,

Anehionin the land. ,

Of thee it claims repoee :
Or life or death is fairly eern'd
By its millenniel woeS.
8. It cannot be that all in vain
Have counhless hears been shed,
Or veinly for the fatherssland
Unnumber’d hearts heve bled.
9. It cannot be thet strength end wit
And purpose pure end high, .
Orush'd by the weighh of endless curse
should pine away, and die.
10. There yet will come e bether day,-
Yes‚ come it will, it must,-

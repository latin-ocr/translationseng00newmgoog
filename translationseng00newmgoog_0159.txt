Are not theroeks their funeral-pileo, ·
The sees and shores their gmvee
Go, stranger Ι treek ‘ehe deep :
Free, free the white sail spread.

Wave may not soem, nor wild wind sweep,
Where rest not England’e dead„

ROSE OF ARGYLESHIRE.

1. Ae* the silence of twilight’s contemplative hour
I have mus'd in e sorrowful meod
01‘1 the wind-sheken weeds which emboeom th'e bow'r,
¹ Where the home of my forefathers eleotl
All ruined and wild ie their roofless ebode,
And lonely the derk raven’s eheltering t1e03
And travelled by few is the grass-eover'd read.
Where the hunter of deer and the warrior trodo
To hie hille that eneirele the see

2. Yet wandering, I found on my mineus welk
By the dial-stone eged end green ¹
One rose of the wilderness left on ile stall,
Το mark where a gerden had beexe
Ilke a brotherless hermil‚ the lest of ils mee,

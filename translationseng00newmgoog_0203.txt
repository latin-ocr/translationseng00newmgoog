Milder yet thy snowy breezes ³
Pour on yonder* tented eborea,

Where the Rhine'e broad billow freezee,
Orthe derk-brown Danube roem. ,

Oh winde of winter, list ye bbere

To many a deep and dying groen ;
Or stare, ye demone of the midnight eis,

Ae shrieks end thundere louder than your own.
Alae! ev'n your unhassow'd breath

May spare the viatim, fallen low3

Ι But· Men will 'ask no trude to death,
No bounds to human woe.

TYROLRSE HYMN.

1. Mfflm every bosom boundeth, mem'ly oh 1
Where the song of Freedom soundeth, mendy oh!
There the warrior’s'arms Ι shed more splendor, .

There the maiden’s chenne Ι shine more tendet!
Every joy the land surmundeth, mem'ly oh!

2. Wearily every bosom pineth, wearily oh!
where the bond of Slave1ytwineth, wearily oh!
There dhe warrior’s dade Ι heth no fleetness‚
There the maiden's heart Ι haeh no sweetnees.
Every flow'r of life declinem, wearily oh!

Ο my sed hem, long abandon’d by pleasure,
Why did it doat on e fasefading measure? ’
Tears, like the ra'mdrop, may fan without measure ;
But raptare end beauty they eennot reeelL
5. Yeb‚ all its sed recollectione suppressing,
⁸ One dying wish my lone bosom ean draw:
Erin! an exile bequeaths thee his blessing3
Land of my forefathers 1. Erin-go-bragh! κ
Buried and oold when my‘heart stills its motion,
Green be thy fields, sweetesb isle of the ocean!
And thy harpetriking bards sing aloud with devotion,
Erin mavournin! Erin-g0·bregh ἒ

MIDNIGHT BEF ORE OORINTH.

'TIS midnight. On the mountains brown
The eold round moon shines deeply down
Blue roll the waters: blue the sky
Spreads like an ooeen hung on high,
’· Bespengled with those isles of light
So wildly spiritually bn'ght.
Who ever gaz’d upon them shining
And turn’d to earth without repining,
N or wish’d for wings to flee away ,
· And mix with their etemel ray?
· The waves on either shore lay there,
CeIm, clear and azure es the air3
And searee their soem the pebbles shook,
But murmur’d meekly es the brook.

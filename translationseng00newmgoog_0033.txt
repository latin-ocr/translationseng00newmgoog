2. Neererl come; end 0'er thy form,

As if to quell the beauteous storm
Theb ever battles there,

I see e veil of tendor hue,

A rainbow of ethereal dew,

Ι Hang lightly in the eir.

13. The mighty brother pines have shed
Their inuiis emund thy roeky bed:
Τῂθ eagle's wing is slowly spread

Above thy eloud of feam.
Has Nature a more glorious child

Than thou, the wonderful end wild
In thine own mountain home?

-4. Yet, ss I stand upon thy beni,
Ii seems, that but a leeble link
Restreins my footeteps, ere they sink
In thal bright waste below:
But who would wish, the secret things

The wonders of the engiy springs,
In thy ebyss to know?

> 5. Thou ‘seem’st e child ol wreth, end yet
Those smiles upon thy wetere set
Tell not of passion's strile.
If passion-bom thy music ring
Surely thou eni the fnresl thing
Thet discord gives to life.

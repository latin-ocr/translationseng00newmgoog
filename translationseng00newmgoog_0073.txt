3. Save to us, our night-wahch keeping'
&orm-winda to brave,
While tho very sea-bird sleeping
Rests in its cave.
Think of us, when heanhs are gleaming3
Think of us, when mead is streaming3
Ye, of whom our souls are dreaming

On the dark wave.

TURKISH SUNSET.

1, WARM o'er the waters the red sun is glowing:
’Tis the last parting glauce 'of his splendour and might :
While each rippfing wave on the bright shore is throwing
Its white erest, that breaks into showers of light. Ι ¹

2. Each distant mosque and minaret κ
I's shiningin the setting sun, ff
Whose farewell look is brighter yet ·

Thau that with which his course begun.

3. On the dark blue mountains his smile is brighh:
It glows on the orange-grove’s waving height,
And breaks through its shade in long lanes of light.

4 N'o sound on the earth and no sound in the shy,
Save murmuring fountains that sparkle nigh,
And the rustling flight of the evening breem,
Who steah from his nest in the oypress trees,

* Seapm, shnft (οἰ a pillar), here used sor Minaret.

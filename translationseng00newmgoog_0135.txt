THE EAGLE.

l. Nor in the meadow end 1101 on the shore,
And not on the wide heath with furze covered o’er‚
Where the ory 01 ‘ohe plover‚ ‘ohe hum 0111101100,
Give e feeling 01 joysul seouriiy3
And 1101 in the woods where the nightingale’s song
From the 0110011111 and orange poure all the day long;
And not where 1110 martin hee built in the eevee,
And the redbreeet onoe eover’d the children with leaves ;-·
Shall ye find the proud eegle. Oh, nol come ewey! 1
Ι will show you 1110 dweiling end point out 1110 prey.

⁶ . Awey! let us* go where 1110 mountaine ere high,
With 1011 splint’ring peeks tow'n'ng into the sky ;

Where old ruin'd 0001100 are dreery and lone, ι w
And seem es if built 101 a world that 10 gone.
There, up on the topmoei iow'n blaok as ‘ohe nighi,

Sits ihe old moneroh eagle in full bleze 01 light.

He 10 king 01 these mountains. Save him and 1110 mate,

No eegle dwells here: he 10 lonely end green
Looln look how he 0110, with 1110 keen glenoing eye
Ι And 1110 proud head thrown book, looking 11110 the sky.

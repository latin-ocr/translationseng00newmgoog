7. Thon thou saw’st the¹ sattling ocean,
Calming from its wild commotion;
And less mighty than tho first

Forth a new creation burst!

. Saw’st each orestad billow riso.
With ten thousand forms of life3
Saw'st tha budding sea-wead grow
In the tranquil daeps below,

And within the ocean-mines
Honrly branching corallines.

. Thou didst know tha saa, era man ’
His first voyage had bagun—

All tha World hadst sailed about
Ere Amerioa was found out ;

Era Ufyssas and his men
sailed for Ithaca again ;

η Ere among tha isles of Greeee„ .
Want J ason for the golden'fleeoe.

. Thou wast safling o'er tha sea, .
Brave old voyager, marrily,
While within the forest grew
The trae whr‘oh made the first canoa
Daring circumnavigator‚
Would thou wart thina own narrator!

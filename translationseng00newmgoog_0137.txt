And hai-k to the rush of his outspreaiiing winge,
Like the coming of temptent, as upward he springs.
And non, how the eohoing mountains are eiin'd ἲ
For ’ohai was the voice of the engle you heard.

Now see how he soors! Likea speck in the height
Of the bluewaulted sky, and now lost in the light,
Now downward he wheels, as a shafi from a bow
By a strong archer sent, to the valleys below.

And that is the bloet of a lamb of the fiook!

One moment3 and he reascends to the roek. ' ἵ
Yes, see how the oonqn'ror ie winging his wey,
And his terrible inlons are holding their prey.

3. Great bird of the wildernessi lonely and proud,
With a spirit unbroken‚ aneok never bow'd ;
With an eye of defianoe, august and severe,

⁶ Who soom’st en inferior, and hatest a peer:

What- is it that giveth thee beeuiy and worth?
Thou wast made for the desolate places of earth,
To mate with ¹the tempesi3 to match with ohe sea:
And God show'd his pow'r in the lion and thee. ’

ΤΗΕ PALE FLOWER.

1. How fair is thy fece, Pele Flow'r! '
The stans look down on thee, .
And our Father’s sister gazeth
Thy loveliness to see.

Ι Bright, brighi is their deathless ray,
But they know thou 'rt fairer than they. ”
Pale Lily of the water! sweet flow’r 3—o1eop.

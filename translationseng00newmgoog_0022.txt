METRIOAL NOTIOE.

In Samon 1. pieeee 1 to 4 e'ontein lhe eommon Hexameters
and Pentameters. In 5 to 11, lhe Iembie Dimeter ie added
to the Dactylie Hexameter, ee in Horace, Epod. 14 and 15.

In Seenon H. the Anepaestic eysleme are quite regular,

except in 22, where an Anepeestie ie followed by en lambio
Dimeler. I know no precedent for this. My only justification
ie, that it seemed te suit the pieee.

In Samon 111. the Ohoriambiee aee either as in Horace
οι· asin Catullus. In demon IV. the innovation ie chiefly
in the conspolium of stamas. No. 54 hee an initias syllable
id exeees, which ie osten called Ione a majori. No. 59 hae

a Euripidean line, which gives some wildneee.

The metros of deenen V. need no partioular remark,
except that 70-72‚ being Deetylie÷lambi0‚ 'might have been
olaseed ‚wilh 5—113 end that 76, 77 eontein lbocheice and
Oretlcfl (-υ“·).

On Samon Vl. remarks are mede in the Note at the
end. '

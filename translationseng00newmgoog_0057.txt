Α vl. ΥΕ marinors of England
Who guard our native sees,
Whose flag has brav’d, a thousand years,
The battle and the broeze; .
Your glorians standard launoh again
To match another foe,
And sweep through the deep
While the stormy tempests blow.
While the battle rages lond and long
And the stormy tempests blow. .
2. The spirits of yodr fathers
Shall stant from every wave; ·
For, the deok, it was their field of fame,
And ooean was their grave.
x Where Blake and mighty Nelson fell,
Your manly hearts shall glan,
As ye sweep through the deep,
While the stormy tempests blow,
While the battle rages loud andlong
And the stormy tempests blow.
3. Britannia needs no hulwark,
No tow’rs along the steep :
Her maroh is o’er the mountain-nave,
Her home is on the deep. ,

Ι ‘120

2. Where is {he now-maath of wintess

Pure in the forest depths it lay:
But the Great Spirit looked from the stormless heav'ns‚
And the snow·wreath pass’d away,
In its 'own breathing.
3. Where is the eloudlet of Summer2
Palely it slept on the sky's calm breast:
But the winds blew strong and the tempest rose;
The cloud found a darker rest,
No more returning.
4. Lovely wast thou, my sister! .
Gentle and sad as the night's low breath.
Ah! if thou hadst been less sweet and fair,
Thou wouldst not have charm'd eold Death, ,
Nor griev'd'Omeena. ’
5. Vain is the voice of my sonow.
Never again to the earth nor me
Thy spirit returns from the shadowy land:
And with tears shall Ι gaze, like thee,
On stars and fiow'rs. ’
6. Yet will Ι oease from my mourning3
child of the moonlit Ocean foam!
For, a captive and orphan and lonely in woe,
Manitto hath call’d thee home,
To meet the long-lost.
7. Soon'may I come to thee, dearest!
τ Sorrow and bears and the tomb are not there,
And the flow’rs have no fadfflg, the storm never oomeS,
’ And joy fills the boundless air. ·
Sleep, sleep, thou dreamless!

The weshehn wilde among, ·

And free in green Columbia's woods
The hunter’shew is strung. “’ “
But let the'floods rush on: ’
let the arrow’s ssight be sped z· ’

Why should they reeh, whose task is done?
fflwre‘slumber England's dead. ¹

5. The mountain-storms rise high

In' the snowy PyreneeS‚

And hess the pine-boughs ,through 'the “sim
Like rose-leaves on the breem.
But leh the storm rege on:
I'eh the fresh wreaths be shed :

For the Roncesvalles’ field is won 3— Ῑ
There slumber England's‘ dead. v

6. On 'the 'frozen deep's repose . .
’Tis a dark and dreadfulhou1·,

When round the ship the ieefields elose
And the noxhhern nighhelouds leur.
But let the iee dn'ft 0111 ⁵

³ Ieh the eold blue desert spread!

weh eourse with mast and fleg is done:
Ev’h there sleep England’s dead.

The men os field and wave,

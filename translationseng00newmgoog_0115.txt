THE ALBUM.

1. Timr beck the virgin page,
white end unwrihten still:
Some hand more oalm and sege
κ The leaf musi fill.
Thoughts corne, as pure as light ;
Pure as ev’n you require:
sut oh! each word Ι write,
Iove turns to fire.

. Yet leh me keep the book:
oft shall my hears renew,
When on its leaves Ι look, ’
“ Deer thoughts of you.
Like you, ftis fair und brighk3
Like you, too bright and fair, ⁴ ·
To let wild Pession write ‘j
One wrong wish there. ¹

. Haply‚ when from those eyes
Far, far away I roam,
κ Should oelmer thoughts erise
Ι Tow’rds you end home3
Fanoy may truce some line
Worthy those 'eyes to meet, '
Thoughts rhat nothum but shine,-
Pure, calm and sweet.

THE LONE SEA SHORE.

Βῑ the lone see shore Ι moumfnlly beat the waves.
Ἴ Momnfully evermore 1 the wild wind sobe and naves.
A sadness and a sense of deep unress
Brood on the clouds and on the water's breest.
But 101 the white sea mew careering Ι floats indolently by;
And lo! esnowy sail nppeering 1 glesms fair against the sky;
The sadness end the loneliness depart,
And Nature smiles widh sympathy of hoen.
From snowy mountain peak l how sadly we look down
On pmple moorland bleek Ι ungledden'd by a town!
The solemn grendeur is akin to pain :
We look for sympathy snd sigh in vain.
Butif we hear the kine deep lowing Ι or voice of chantioleer,
Orvwadeh the anne smoke upflowingifrom coniage homesteeds
The 'lonely lendseape glitters in the sight, [nese
And human gladness robes ie with deiight.

And the bleekbird in the thicket attune their thronis to sing. i

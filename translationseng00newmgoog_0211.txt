· SONNET ΤΟ NIGHT.

A. Mvsrnarovs Nightl when our First Parent knew
Thee from repert divine and heard thy name,
Did he not tremhle for this lovely treme,
This glorians eanopy of Light and Blue?
a. Yet, ’neath a eurtain of translucent dev,
Bath’d in the rays of the great setting fleme,
Hesperus with the host of heaven earne,
¹ And 10! Creation widen’d in man’e vievv.
a. Who could have thought such dartmees lay eoneeal'd
Within thy baama, Ο Sunt or who could find,
Whilst fly and leaf and inseet stood revead'd,
'dhet to sueh eountless orbs thou mad'st us blind 2
n. Why do we then shun Death with anxious atrise t
If Light ean thus deceive, wherefore not Life 2

SONNET ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ALMIGHTY.

' n. Wrrrr art Thou, Mighty One, and where thy neat?

Thou broodest en the eehn that eheers the landa,
And thou dost bear within thina awful hands

The rolling thunders and the lightnings fleet.

a. Stern on thy darkwrought ear of cloud and wind

Thou guid’st the northern storm at night'a dread neon,
Or on the red wing of the fieree monsoon

Disturb'st the eleeping giant of the Ind.

Sweet voice of comfort! ’twes like hhe steoling
Of summer wind through some wreelhed shell3
Eeeh secret winding, eeeh inmoss feeling
Of ell my soul eohoed to its spell.
’lhres whisper’d helm; 'twas sunshine spoken:
I’d live years oi grief end pain,
'l'o heve my long sleep of sorrow broken
By suoh benign blessed sounds sgein.

ΤΗΕ vinnon BLAOKsMITH.

1. Unnns a spreeding ohestnut tneo
The village smithy stands. .
The smith, e mighty man is he,
With large and sinewy hands,
And the musoles of his brewny arm
Are strong es iron hands.
2. His heir is eiisp end blaok and long3
His faceis like the ten:
His brow is wel with honest sweat:
He· eorns whole'er he can,
And looks the whole world in the feee3
‚memmm.
3. Week in, week out, from monn ‘po night,
Yon oen hear his bellows blow :
You oen heen him swing his heavy sledge
¹ With measur’d beat and slas,
, , Like e sexton ringing the village bell,
When the evening sun is loir.

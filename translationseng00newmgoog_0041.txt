And a mother she war and dr no me ;
For I was born on the open Sea!

5. The waves were white, and red the morn,
In the noisy hour wheanas born; y
And the whale iu whistled the porpoise rolled,
And the dolphins bared their backs of gold ;
And never was heard such an outery wild

r As weleomed to life the ocean child!

6. I’ve lived since then, in calm and strife,
Full fifty summere a sailor'e life,
With wealth to spend and a power to range,
Bur never have sought, nor eighed for change ; ·
And Death, whenever he comesto me,
ShnH come on the wild unbounded seu.

η THE NORTHERN SEAS.

1. Ur, up 1 let us avoyage take!
Why sit we here ab ease?

Find us uvessel right and snug,
Bound for the Northern sees.

2. I long to see the Northern lights, ¹
With their rushing splendours, fly
Like living things with flaming wingS,
Wide o’er the wondrous sky.
3. I long to see those ieebergs raet,
With heads all erown'd with enon,
Whose green roots deep in the ewful deep
Two hundred fathome low.

harderl As to verses called Lyric, Ι do as Horace
and Catullus themselves did—go to the Greeks for
the foundation, and compect the lines into stanzas
suited for the material before me.

Eton masters in old days would not permit to
boys such rhythm as Virgil himself usca, and
obtruded into the third line of the Alcaic a restric-
tion unknown to Horace. Not that I would claim
every liberty for which there is precedent, even in
Catullus ; much less in the dromas known by¹ the

name of Seneca, which carry monotony of lyric-
metre to its maximum. Before the single Choriamb
Catullus and the Greeks seem to prefer a Trochee

to a Spondeo, and allow an lamb. These I follow
rather than Horace. Yet beforeadouble Choriamb
the Spondee is perhaps necessary.

Many treet it as an inadmissible Graecism to
shorten, instead of eliding, a long vowel before a
short3 as: Si me amas3 Ilio- alto: Pelio Ossam.
On the contrary, elision is mimdsocie the liberty,
and the practice of the Greeks alone intelligible.
Elision is here wa great paradox; for it seems as
though adding a vowel mede a phrase shorter.
For instance, Vidi equidem, satisfies Virgil as a
Choriamb ; bnt Vidi quidem is too long, too heavy.
What theory will explain this l

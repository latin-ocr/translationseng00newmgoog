3. Much doch know che'noahem Whaler,
More the great Pacific aailor3
And PhoenicianS, old and gray,

In old times knew more than they;
But, oh! daring voyager small

More thou knoweat than they all! k
Thou didst laugh at sun and bracae,
On 'che new created scas :

4. Thou wast with the dragon broods
In ihc old aea solitudea

¹ Sailing in che new-made light
With 'che atony ammonite!

5. Thou dids‘c survive che awfnl shock,
Thac turned the ocean-bed to rock5
And changed ias myriad living swarms ’
Το the, manble’s veincd forms-
Foaail scrolls ‘chat tell of change
Sudden, terrible and strange!

6. Thou wast there 1 thy little beai,
Airy voyager‚ kept aflcat
O’er ihewaters wild and dismal,
O’er the yawning gulis abysmal.
Amic wreck and avertaming,
Rock-imbedding‚ heaving, buming-
Mid the tumult and the stin,

Thou, most ancient mariner,
In chat pearly boat of chine,
Sat’st upon ‘che troubled brine!

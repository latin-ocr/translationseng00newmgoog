That woo him frnm the meaning main
Beck to her glorious bow'rs again. Ι
4. They woo him, whisp‘ring lovely tales
0f many a flow'ring glade,
And fount’s bright gleam, in island-velet
Of golden-fruited shede.
ν Aeross his lone ship'e wake they bring
A vision and a glow of Spring,
5. And Ο, ye masters of the lay,
Come not ev'n thus your songs,
Ι That meet us on life’s weery way
Amidst her toiling throngs i
Yes‚ o'er the spirit thus they bear
A current of eelestiel air.
6. Their pow'r is from the brighter elime
“ mat n our tren harh part:
. Their tenes ere of the woth whieh Time
Sears not within the heert.
They tellus of the living light
In its green places ever bright.
7. They eall us with avoiee divine
Beck to our early love,-
Our vows of youth at many nemine,
Whence fer end fast we reve.
Weleome high thought and holy strain,
That make us Thnth’s end Heav’n’s again.

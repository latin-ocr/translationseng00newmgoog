And his double wings for heshy night,

And a keen unweerying appetite.

He eomes with Famine and Fear along,

An army aminion mihion strong.

The Goth end the Vandal, end dwarfieh Hnn

With his swarming people wild and dun,

Brought noh the dread that the locust bringS,

’ When is heard the rush of their myried wings.
From the deseres of burning send they speed,

Where the lions roem and the serpente. breed,

Far over the sea, away! away! ι

And they darken the sun et noon of day.

Like Eden the land before rhey find,

But they leave ie a desolate waste behind.

, The peesenb grows pale, when he sees them come„

And standeth before them weak and dumb z

For they come like a raging fire in power,

· And eat up a harvest in half an honr.

.. The trees are bere, end the land is brown,
As if trampled and trod by an army down.
Thereisterror in every monareh’s eye, ’
When he hears that this herrible foe is nigh:
For he knows thar the might of an armed hosh Δ
Cannot drire the spoiler frem out his eoast;
And that terror and famine his land aweit ;
Thae hom norhh to south ’twill be desolate.

Thus the ravening Locust is strong and grim:
And rhet were an armednan to him?

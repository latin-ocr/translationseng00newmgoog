Efflrrs RAINBOW.

1. Errm t the tear end the smlle in thine eyes

Blend like the reinbow thet hange in thy skies.

Shinlng through sorrow's stream,

Seddening through pleesure’e bearn,

Thy eune with doubtful gleem Ι weep while they rise.
2. Erin 1 thy silent tear never shall eease3

Erint thy lehguid smlle n'e’er shall increase ;

Till like the reinbow's light,

Thy various tints unite,

And form in Heev'n's sight Ι one ereh of Peeee.

OMEN TO MARMION.

1. Wfflerer shall the lover rest, Ι whom the Fetes sever
From his true maiden’s breest Ι perted for ever?
Where through groves deep end high Ι sounds the fer billow;
Where early violete dle, Ι under the willow;
Eleu lero! Ι eost shall be hispillow. Ι
2. There through the summer’s day Ι οοοΙ streame are leving:
There, while the tempests sway, Ι seereeere boughswaving.
There thou thy rest shall take, Ι parted for ever,
N ever again to wake, Ι never, oh never:
Eleu, loro! Ι never, oh never.
· 3. Whe1e ehell the treitor rest, Ι he, the deceiver.
who eould win maiden’s breeet Ι ruin end leave herl
In the lost battle, Ι borne down by the flying‚
Whe1e mlngles war’s rettle Ι with the greans of the dying ;
Elere, lero, Ι there shell he be lylng.

1. Souofthe Ooeanhh, 1
Where sleep your mighhy dead? Ι

Show me what high and statehy pile ⁵ ·

Is reax’d o’er glory’s beth

G0‚ stranger 1 track the ᾶεψς

hee, free tho white sail spread: · ,
, Wave may not foam, nor wilh wind sweep,

Where rest not England's heah

2. On Egypt's buming plains

By the pyramid o’ersway’d‚

with fearful pow'r the noonduy reign&
And the palm-tree's yield no ahad&
But let the angry sun .
From heav’n look fiercely red,

Unfelt by those whose task is done 1.
There slumber England's dead..

3. The hurricane hath might
Along the Indian shore 3
And far by Ganges’ banks at night
Is heard the tigeffs roar.
But let the sound roll 0111
1t hath no tone of dread
For those that from their toils are gone ε
Thero slumber England’s dead.

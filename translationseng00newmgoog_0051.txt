From mountain cliftsl what veles,
Basking benealh the noontide sun,
Theb high and hotly sails!
21. Yet all about the breezy shore,
Unheedful of the g10W‚
Look how the children of the South -
Are passing lo and fro!
22. What noble forms! what fairy place!
Cast anehor in this eove :
Push out lhe bost ε for in this land
A little we must rove.
23. We’ll wander on through wood and field :
We’ll sit beneeth the vine ε
We'll drink the limpid coeoassmilk
And pluck the native pino.
24. The breadfruit and eassada roob,
And many a glowing berry
’ Shell be our feast: lothere ab least
Why should not we be menyl
25. For ’tis a Southern Parsdise,
All gladsome3 plain and shore:
A land so far, that here we are,
“ But shall be here no more.
26. We've seen the splendid southern olims,
Its seas and isles and men:

So nova, back to a desrer land,
Το England beck againl

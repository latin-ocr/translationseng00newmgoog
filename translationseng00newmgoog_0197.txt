Tum ie not in the wide world e volley so eweet

Ao thar vele in whose bosom lhe bright wetere meet.
Oh, theraeo reys of feeling end life murt clepere,

Ere the bloom of that velley ehell fede from my hearl

Yet ir wne not thar Nature hed ehed o'er the 'soene
Her puresl of orystol and brightest of green:
’roas nol the eost magio of streamler end hill :

Oh no l it wes something more exquisite still

’Twae'thol friends, the belorfd of my bosom, were neor,
Who mede every deor scene of enohantment more deer3
And who felt how the besl oherms of nature improve
When we eee them refleo’oed fmm looke that we love. Ῑ

In thy bosom of obedo, with the friends Ι love beet,
Where the etorms lhelwe feelin thie oold world should oease,
And our hoerle, like thy wetere, be mingled in peeoe.

His toils are borne with lightsome choen

And over may *they spoed,

Who feeble age and helpmates deur .
And tendor baimies foed,

2. We cast our lines ithgo Bay3

Our nobs am -floating wide:

' Our bonny boat, wibh yielding sway.
Roeks lightly on tho tide.

And happy prove our duily lot
Upon the summer sea,

And blest on land our kindly cot,

Where all our toeasmves be.
3. The mermaid on her rook may sing ;

The witoh may weave her oharm :

Nor waterasprite nor eldrieh* thing
The bonny boat can ham

It eafely bears its sealy storo
Through' many a stormy gale,

while joyful shouts rise fmm the shom
Its homeward prow to hail.

THE FATE OF THE OAK

Ι 1. THE owl to her mate ¹is calling ς ¹
The river his hoarse song sings;
But tho oak is marked for falling,
what has stood for a hundred :springs-

⁸ Effish.

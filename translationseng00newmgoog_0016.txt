ix.

It may be well to stete that my vacillation ι
between ce end ae in e few words is net from care·
leesness or misprint: hut because I have no cen-
viction which of the two is iight, and it is better
for leemers to be eware that at least in old editions
of the classice they may meet either. The anthon'ty
of this or thet MS. ic easily everrant since the
corrupt pronunciation of efer ee oe is very ancient

in Iteiy.

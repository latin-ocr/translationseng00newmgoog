SEOTION III. ,

rnn worm> or rnnnnnn.

1. As e boam o’er the fece of the wasers may glow,
While the tide runs in darkness end coldness belorr,
So the ohesk may be ting’d with a worm sunny smile,
Though the oold hears to ruin runs darkly the while.

2. One fatal remembrsnoe, one sorrow, rhet throws
Its bleak shade alike o’er our joys ond our woes,
To whioh life nothing dorker or brighter oon bring,
For which joy has no belm ond affliction no sting3

2².. Oh, this thought in the midst of enjoyment will stay,
Like a deod leofiess brenoh in the summer's night ray.
The beams of she worm sun, play round ir in vain ε
It may smjle in his light, but it blooms not again.

1. How ofs has the Benshee oried!
How oft has Dessh untied
Brighr links that Glory πονε,
Sweet bonds entwin’d by Love!
Peaoe to eeoh manly soul thar sleepeth;
Rest to each faithful eye that weepeth.

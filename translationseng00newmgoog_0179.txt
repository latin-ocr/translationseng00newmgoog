· Iovns‘ nonno nnnnn„

l. 011, tho days ere gone, when Beeuhy bright
My heerh’s ohon‘n wove 3
When ,my dmum of life, from monn to nighh,
Was Iove, still Lovo.
New hope moy bloom,
And days may come
Of milder oalmer heom,
But there’e nothing half so swoeh in life,
An Love's young dream:
’ Oh, thene's nothing half so sweet in life,
An Love's young dream.
2. Though the bend to puter fame moy noer,
When wild youth's poeh;
Though he win the wine, who frown'd before,
To smile et lest3
He'll never meet
“ Α joy so sweeo
, In all his noon of fame, '
As when first he sang to women's ear ’
His son-felt fleme,

And et eveny close she blush'd to hear ι
The one-lov'd neme.

3. Oh, thet hallow’d form is no'er fongot,
Which First Love heo’d:
Stin iolingering honnts the greonest spot
On Memorfn waste.

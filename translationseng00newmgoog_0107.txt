ΤΟ Α DEOEASED SISTER.

1. I rmum of thee, my sister,
In my sad end lonely hours3
And the thought of thee comes o’er mo
like the breath of morning flow'rs.
Like musio that enohents the ear,
. Like sights that bleso the eye,
like the verdum of the meadov,
The ezure of the sky3
like reinbow in the evening‚
Like blossom on the tree,
Is the thought of thee, deor Cherlotte‚-·
¹Is the tender thought of thee.

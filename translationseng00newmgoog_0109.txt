2. Ι think on thee, my sister,

Ι think on thee at evera

When Ι see the first and fairest star
Steal peaoeful out of heaven.

I hear thy sweet and touehing voice
ln each soit breeze that blows,

Whether it wast red autumn-leaf
Or fan the summer rose.

Mid the w‘aste of yon lone heath,
By this desert meaning sea,

Ι moum forthae, dear Charlotte,
And shall ever mourn for thee.

SUNNY ISLE OF OUR OWN.

1. ΟΠ had we some bright little isle of our own,
ln a hlue summer ooeen3 far off and alone,
Where a leaf never dies in the still blooming how'rs,
And the hee banquets on through awhole year of flow'rs 3 y
Where the sun loves to pause.
With so fond a delay,
That the night only draws
A thiu weil o'er the day ;
Where simply to feel that we breathe‚ that we live,
ls worth the best joy that life elsewhere ean give.

2. There, with souls ever ardent ond pure as tho olime,
Wo should love as they lov’d in the first golden time.

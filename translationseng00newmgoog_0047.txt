6. The moon uprising like e eun,

So stahely, large end sheen,
And the very soors, like cluster’d moons,
In the crystel ether keen.

7. While all about ohe ship below
strange fiery hillows play,
The oeeseless keel through liquid fire
euos wondrously iis way.
8. But oh! the South, the halmy Southl
How werm ohe breezes fioet 1
How worm the amber waiers stream ·
From off our basking boat!
9. Come down, oome down from the tell ship'e side:
What a marvellous sight is here 1
Lookl purple rocks and orimson treeS, '
Down in the deep so clear.
10. See where those shoals oi dolphins go,
A glad and glorious hand,
Sporting among the dayhright woodo
0f a corel feiry land.
11. See on the violet sends benea‘oh
How the gorgeous s‘hells do glidel
Ο Sea, old Sea! who yet knows half
Of thy wonders and thy pride? Ι
12. Look, how the seaplante trembling fleat,
All like e mermoid's looks,
Waving in thread of ruby red
Over those nether rocks.

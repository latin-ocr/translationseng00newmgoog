All wild ιιι the silence οι nature, it drew
From each wandering snnbeam alonely embrace: -
For th'e nightwaed and thorn ovemhadowed the place,
Where the flow'r οι my farefathers' grew. , ι

3. Sweet bud οι the wildamess! emblem of all·
That remeins in this desolate hesit! ·
The fabric of bliss tc its centra may fall, ·,
But patience shall never depart;
Though the wilds cf enchantment‚ all vernol and height, —
In the days οι delusicn by fancy combin'd
Wit th the vanishing phantoms οι love and delight ,—
Abandon my seul like a dream of the night,
And leave but a desert behind. “ ,⁹

4. ·Be hush'd, my dark spirit ι for wisdom sondemus}
When the faint and the feehle deplora:
Be strong as· the rock cf the ocean, which stems
A thousand wild waves on the shore. .
Through the perils cf chance and the seowl οι disdain
May thy frent he hnelter’d, thy courageelate:
Yes, even'the name· 1 have worshipp’d in vain
Shall aweks nottho sigh of rememhrance again:
Ι To be'sr is to conquer our fate. '

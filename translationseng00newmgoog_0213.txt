1. Α. BY the hope within us springing,
' Herald of io-morrow’s strife,
By that sun, whose light is bringing
Chains cr Freedom, death or life3 “
Β. Oh rememher, life can be
N ο charm for him, who lives noi free.
Like the daystar in the wavc,
’ Sinks ahero in hisgrave,
r. Mid the dewfall of a nation's hears.
Happy is he, 0'er whose decline
The smiles oi home may scothing shine,
And light him down the sheep of years.
But oh, how grand they sink to rest,
Who close their eyes on Victory's breasi!

Now the loeman's ehcek turns white,
When his heari that¹ field remembers,
Where we dimm'd his glory's light.
B. Never let him bind again
A chain, like that we broke from then.

vinies nr niens. ·

1. N iens in her dark nrrey Ι steels o’er the ocean,
And with departed day Ι hush’d seems its motion.
Slowly o'er yon blue coest Ι onward she’s treeding,
Till its dark line is lost Ι neath her veil spreading.
The berk on rhenippling deep Ι heth found a pillos,
And the pale moonbeams sleep Ι on the green billow.

. Bound by her emerald zone Ι Venice is living,
And round her marble crown Ι night winds are sighing
From the high lattiee now Ι bright eyes are glearning‚

Thet seem on night's dark brow Ι brighter stans beanring.
3. Now o’er the blue lagoon Ι light barks are daneing,
nne neatlr the silver moen Ι s'wift ears ere gleneing.

Streins from the mandolin Ι steal o’er the water :
Eeho replies between Ι to mirth end leughter.
O’er the ware seen afer Ι brilliantly shining,
(lleams like a fallen ster Ι Venice reclining.

THE STORMY PETREL.

,. Α 'tironense miles from land are we,
Tossing about 011 the roering sea;
From billow to bounding billow east,
like fleeey snow en the stormy blest:
'l'lre seils ere seattered about like weeds3
'l'ke strong masts shake, like quivering reeds3
The mighty rables end iron chains, ’
'llre hull, which ell eerthly strength disdainS,
They strein and they eraek; end heerts of stone
'l'lreir natural hard prend strength disown.

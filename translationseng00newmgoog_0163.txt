1. 1 cmm, I come: ye heve called me long:
I come o'er the Ἴ mountaine with light end eeng.
Ye may mene my step o'er eh'e wakening earth
By the winde which tell of the violet’s birth,
By the primmee-etere in the ehedowy grase, ·
By the green leaves opening ee 1 pam.

2. Iheve brenth’d on the south, end the eheenut flowers
⁴ By thomends heve burst from the forertnbowem
And the ancient graves end the fallen senes
Are veil’d with wreethe on Italian pleim.

But it ie not for me in my hom· of bloom
' To speek of the min or the temb.

3. Ι heve leok'd o'er the hille of the seormy north,
¹ And the lereh hes hung all his tessels forth,
And the fisher is out on the eunny eea,
’ And the reindeer bounds o'er the pmtures free3
And the pine hes e ningo of aefter green,
And the mose looks bright, where my feet heth been

4. I heve sent through the wood pethe e glowing sigh,
And eell’d out eeeh voice ef the deep blue eky3
From the night bird’s ley ehrough the stany time

· In the grovee of the soft Hesperien elimo,
Το the ewen’e wfld note by the Ieelnnd lakes,
Where the derk fir-breneh inte verdure breaks.

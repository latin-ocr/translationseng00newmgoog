In vain the hero’s heart hath blod 3

The sage’s tongue hath warn’d in vain:

Ο Freedom! on'ce thy flame hath fied,
It never lights again.

2. Weep on! perhaps in aster days
They'll leam to love your name3 -
When many a daed shall wake in praise,
That now* must sleep in blame.
And when th'ey tread the min’d isle,
Where rest at length the lord and slave, ,
Thefll wondering ask, how hands so vile
Oould conquer hearts so brave„

. ’Twas'F'ate (thefll say,) awaywenl Fato

Your web of diseord wove3 ·
, - And while your rymnts joined in hate,
You never join'd in love.
But, hearte fell off, that ought to wine,
And man profan'd‚ what God hath given,
Till some'wem heard to curse the shrine, ·
Where others knelt to heaven

SOOTOH FISHERMAN'S SONG.

1. OsmeY glides the bonny boat ’
J ust parted fmm the shore,

And to the fisher's chorus-noto ·
Soft moves the dipping oar.

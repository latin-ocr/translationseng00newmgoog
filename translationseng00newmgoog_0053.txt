THE TIME ΟΕ CHARLEMAGNE.

1. Timar was plenty in the forest ;
There was plenty on the plain3
Lusty peasants² noble heroes,
In the time of Charlemagne :
. Righi was right and wrong was evil;
nuth was never the'n too plain ;
All the hears came forth in musio,
In the time of Oharlemagne.
2. Every man was free io follow
¹ Bird or wild beast to irs den;
Every man maintained his quarrel
With she sword and not the pen:
Manly thoughts and simple habits
Brought us health, and banished pain :
We have changea-(for worse or better 2)
Since the time of Oharlemagne.
3. Beauty won her bloom from Nature5
Wives were constant,¹ maidens true;
Men were bold, strong, clear, unbending,
As the brave bright steel they drew3
N one did risa bui by his merit3
None did sell his soul for gain ;
Words did never hide man's meaning,
In the time of Oharlemagne.

2. On lengh Neagh’s bank ee the fisherman straye

When the eleer, eold eve's deelining,

He sees the Ronnd Towess ol ether days
In the wave beneeth him shining.

Oatah aglimpse of the days thet ere over;

Thus, sighing, look through the wavee of time
For the long iaded glories theyeover. , ’

BATTLE OF HOHENLINDEN.

1. ΟΝ Lindon, when the sun was low,
All bloodless lay the untrodden snow,
And dark aa winter was the flow

Of Iser rolling rapidly.

2. But Linden¹ saw another sight,

When the drum beat at dead of night,
Commanding fires of death to light
The darkness of her seene1y.

3. By toreh and trumpet fest aney'l
Eech horsemen drew his battle-blade3

And furious every charger neigh’d
Te jein the dreadful revehy.

4. Then shook the hills with thunder rim
Then rush’d the steed to battle driv’n,

long may the fair and bravo
, Sigh 0’er the hero's grave.
2. We’re fall’n upon gloomy days:
Star after star decays.
Every bright name, that shed
Lighh o’er the land, is fied.
Dark falls the tear of him who mourneth
Lost joy, or hope that ne’er returneth :
But brightly flows the tear,
Wept o'er a hero's bier.
3. Oh, queneh'd are our beacon-lights1
' Thou, of the hundred fights Ι
Thou, on whose buming tongue
Truth peace and freedom hung!
Both mute : but long as Valour wineth,
Or Merofs soul at war ropineth
So long shall Erin's pride
Tell how they liv'd and died.

MASSAGRE oh GLENOOE.

1. 0 mh me, harpen wherefore flow
Thy wayward notes of wail and woe
Far down the desah of Glencoe,

Where none may list their melodyh
Say, harp'st thou to the mists that hy,
Or to the dun deer glanoing by,

Or to the eagle, that from high

Screams chorus to thy minstrelsyh

EXILE OF ERIN.

13 mmm cameto tho beooh a poor exile of Erin3
The dew on his thin roho was hoovy ond ohill:
For his country he oigh'd, when ot twilight repairing
To wonder alono by tho wind-booten hilt
But the day-otor attracted hio eyos’ sod devotion,
For it roso o’or his own nativo islo of tho ooeon;
Where once, in tho fire of his youthful emotion,
. He song the bold anthom ot Edu-gobmgh. .
. Sod is my foto, said tho beart-broken mogon
The wild deor and wolf to o eovert oon floe ;
· But Ι have no refuge from famine ond danger,
A home and a oounhy romain not to me.
Never again, in the green smmy boyrs
Where my forefothors litto, shohl Ispend tho swoot houm,
Or oovor my harp with tho wito-voven fiow’m,
And striko to the numbers of Erin-gohrogh
. Erin! my oo'unt1y1 though sod ond forsoken,
In doeoms 1 revisit thy seo-booten shore:
But alos! in a for foreign lond 1 oothon,
And sigh for th'e friends who oon meet mo no moro.
0 oruel fatet wilt thou novor replaoe mo '
¹ In o mansion of peooe, where no perils oon ohaoo mo?
N ever again shall my brothers embraco mot
They died to defend mo or live to deploro.
4. Whorois my cabin door, soot to the wild woodt
Sistors ond siret did yo weop for itt follt
Where io tho mother that look'd on my ohildhood,
'And where o the bosom-foeno omer than all?
